  for (let row = 1; row <= rows; row++) {
    for (let position = 1; position <= seatsPerRow; position++) {
      const seat: Seat = {
        id: `seat-${row}-${position}`,
        number: `${row}${seatLabels[position - 1]}`,
        row,
        position,
        type: determineSeatType(row, position, config),
        isAvailable: true,

  const availability = await this.checkSeatAvailability(scheduleId, seatIds);
  
  if (!availability.available) {
    throw new Error(`Seats not available: ${availability.unavailableSeats.join(', ')}`);
  }

  // Create reservation with expiration
  const reservation: SeatReservation = {
    id: `res-${Date.now()}`,
    scheduleId,
    seatIds,
    userId,
